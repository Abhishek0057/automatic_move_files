# Automatic Move Files
This python script monitors a specific folder and automatically move files of that folder into specific sub folders like 'images', 'development', 'videos' and 'software' keeping all files organized in the respective folder.   

Tip: It works realtime, use this code for your downloads folder and whenever you download any file, it will keep them organized and automatically moving that file to their respective folder :)
